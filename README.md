# AllMyData: Event Sourcing All My Data (to never forget it)

This is an Event Sourcing implementation in Scala, based on the
original [Dbd][Dbd] ideas (which was naively reinventing the Event
Sourcing concepts and using them for better storage and distributed
caching of [RDF triples][RDF] to provide better handling of Linked
Data ...).
